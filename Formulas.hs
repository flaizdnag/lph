{-
 - Logic programs in the propositional case are defined as sets of Horn
 - clauses, which in turn can be defined in the following way:
 -
 - a{0} <- a{1} , ... , a{n} , ~a{n+1} , ... a{m}
 -
 - where a{0}, ..., a{m} are propositions called atoms. Atom a{0} is called the
 - head of a Horn clause and the rest of the atoms, i.e. a{1}, ..., a{m} form
 - the body of a Horn clause. As it can be seen in the above example, there are
 - two types of atoms in the body of a Horn clause: atoms and negated atoms.
 - Since the negated atoms occur only in the body of a Horn clause, we decided
 - to instead of defining the negation itself, implement a Horn clause as a
 - tuple with atom (the head of a Horn clause), list of atoms that occur
 - without the negation in the body of a Horn clause and list of atoms that
 - occur with negation in the body of a Horn clause.
