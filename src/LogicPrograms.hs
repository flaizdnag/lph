              Horn clauses.

Logic programs in the propositional case are defined as sets of Horn clauses,
which in turn can be defined in the following way:

\[
a_0 \leftarrow a_1 , ... , a_n , \sim\!a_{n+1} , ... , \sim\!a_m
\]

where \(a_0\), ..., \(a_m\) are propositions called atoms, \(\leftarrow\) is
a simple connector and \(\sim\) represents negation as finite failure.
Atom \(a_0\) is called the head of a Horn clause and the rest of the atoms,
i.e. \(a_1\), ..., \(a_m\), form the body of a Horn clause. As it can be seen in
the example above, there are two types of literals in the body of a Horn clause:
atoms and negated atoms. Since the negated atoms occur only in the body of a
Horn clause, we decided to implement a Horn clause as a tuple with atom (the
head of a Horn clause), a list of atoms that occur without the negation in the
body of a Horn clause, and a list of atoms that occur with negation in the body
of a Horn clause, instead of defining the negation itself.

This module contains definitions of types for atoms, Horn clauses and logic
programs, as well as functions that provide essential properties of Horn clauses
and logic programs.
