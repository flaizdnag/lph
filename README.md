# Logic Programs in Haskell

### Abstract
The aim of this project is to implement propositional version of logic programs in Haskell. Additionally,Â the definition of an acceptable logic program will be implemented along with the procedure that allows to determine this property of a given logic program. We give a brief description of the formal background for logic programs and the problem we want to deal with.

### Logic programs

Propositional logic programs are sets of Horn clauses.

### Acceptability of a logic program
